# Python Shared Memory

This project uses the `multiprocessing.shared_memory.SharedMemory` class, which allows a block of memory to be used by multiple Python processes. Since Python 2.6, `multiprocessing` is a built-in module. It ships with Python2 (>= Python 2.6) as well as Python3, no specific installation step is needed.
